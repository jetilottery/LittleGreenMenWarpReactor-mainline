The clusters disappear and the score for each planet increases as new planets fall in from above. Win a prize when you collect enough identical planets. Trigger the Warp Bonus when you collect 4 UFOs – you might even win a prize instantly! Collect 4 asteroids and trigger the Whirl Bonus: the planets may shift position on the grid, where they may be randomly collected to create new clusters and even better chances at winning a prize!

        <p>The object of <em><b class="blackFont">Little Green Men Warp Reactor</b></em> is to match 3 or more identical, adjacent planets. </p>
        <p>When 3 or more identical planets are adjacent in the grid, they create clusters. The clusters are removed and the score for each planet increases accordingly. Collect the required number of any planet to win a prize. Multiple prizes are available for each planet.</p>
        <p>Collect 4 UFOs to trigger the Warp Bonus and collect additional planets. Collect a Star symbol to win a prize instantly.</p>
        <p>Collect 4 asteroids to trigger the Whirl Bonus. Planets may change position on the grid, where they may be randomly collected or form new clusters.</p>

        <p>Play ends when no clusters remain on the grid and all the bonus games are completed. A message appears indicating the game's outcome.</p>
